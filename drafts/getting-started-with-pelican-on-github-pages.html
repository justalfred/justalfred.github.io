                <p>I want more people to blog.
I want more people to give voice to their experiences.
Especially those people who think they have nothing to say.
It&#8217;s not that I think we need more noise on the internet.
It&#8217;s that the conversations out there are often dominated by a few loud voices that are often not representative of the masses.
It&#8217;s that sometimes the most helpful thing for you to hear is that someone out there has gone through what you&#8217;re going through and can tell you something about the experience.
I want more people to&nbsp;blog.</p>
<p>There are various guides out there that show how easy it is to get started publishing with Pelican.
My problem is that I don&#8217;t like uncertainty, and these guides typically explain &#8216;what&#8217;, but not &#8216;why&#8217;.
What are all these auto-generated files for?
How do I customize the look and organization?
How can I be sure I don&#8217;t expose more information than I want?
Because of my insecurity, it took me a lot longer to get started than I wanted.
Here is my summary of the steps I ended up taking, and an explanation of what each step does.
Hopefully this will save the reader time bouncing around various tutorials, blog posts, and&nbsp;documentation.</p>
<h1>Intent</h1>
<p>I wanted a blogging platform which allows me to draft in Markdown.
I didn&#8217;t want to pay much money, and I wanted to avoid having to serve a website.
After a few months of indecision, I settled on using Pelican to generate a static website which I would host on Github Pages.
Pelican has the advantage of being well supported and in a language that I like (Python).
Github Pages is free and allows me to use a custom domain.
I set everything up at the start of January, and haven&#8217;t touched it since.
So this is my best recollection of how I got&nbsp;started.</p>
<h1>Pelican</h1>
<p>If you&#8217;re not familiar with the terminology so far, Pelican is a Python library that lets you generate static websites from templates.
By static, we mean that the content served is the same for everyone because it&#8217;s generated in advance.
Blogs are typically static while ecommerce sites (where you login, have an account, order history, etc.) are typically not.
Templates save the blogger from having to muck about with verbose <span class="caps">HTML</span>.
<a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> and <a href="http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html">reStructuredText</a> are two templating formats that Pelican handles well.
As an example, Markdown lets you write: <code>[a link](http://blog.justalfred.com)</code> instead of: <code>&lt;a href="https://blog.justalfred.com"&gt;a link&lt;/a&gt;</code>.
Pelican itself is highly customizable and extensible.
You&#8217;ll want to be somewhat familiar with Python and git to have an easy time following along.
I&#8217;ve been working in Arch Linux, but these instructions will probably work in <span class="caps">OSX</span> as well.
Windows users will have to interpret the commands and paths&nbsp;accordingly.</p>
<h1>Install</h1>
<p>So let&#8217;s get started.
You can create a new python virtual environment if you want.
If you&#8217;re sloppy and lazy like me, just go ahead and install a few&nbsp;packages.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nv">$ </span>pip install pelican Markdown typogrify
</pre></div>


<p>Markdown is, of course, only necessary if you want to use Markdown.
<a href="http://static.mintchaos.com/projects/typogrify/">Typogrify</a> makes things a little prettier.
Also&nbsp;optional.</p>
<h1>Generate the initial&nbsp;boilerplate</h1>
<p>The first thing to do now is to use the quickstart script to generate a skeleton for your blog.
This step doesn&#8217;t make your blog, but it makes the files you&#8217;ll use later to make your blog.
If you mess up, you can delete the generated folder and just start right over.
For most of the prompts, you can just accept the default.
For most of the rest, you can always change those settings later if you change your mind.
In particular, though, I strongly recommend generating the&nbsp;Makefile.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nv">$ </span>pelican-quickstart

Done. Your new project is available at <span class="nv">$SOME_DIR</span>
</pre></div>


<p>At this point, you can navigate to the folder where Pelican guides you (<code>$SOME_DIR</code>) and find the following new files and&nbsp;folders:</p>
<ul>
<li>develop_server.sh - This is a very useful shell script for seeing the effects of your updates and is called by the&nbsp;Makefile.</li>
<li>Makefile - This file defines <code>make</code> commands that perform the most important&nbsp;tasks</li>
<li>pelicanconf.py - This file contains settings to customize your&nbsp;site</li>
<li>publishconf.py - This file contains settings that only used when you&#8217;re ready to publish to the&nbsp;web</li>
<li>content/ - This folder is where you&#8217;ll put the templates and files that will be translated into the content of your&nbsp;site</li>
<li>output/ - This folder might not exist until you convert your content into&nbsp;html</li>
<li>fabfile.py - This has something to do with <a href="http://www.fabfile.org/">fabric</a> which I don&#8217;t&nbsp;use</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of these are discussed in further detail&nbsp;later.</p>
<h1>Initial&nbsp;content</h1>
<p>You&#8217;ll want to add some <a href="http://docs.getpelican.com/en/latest/content.html">content</a> now.
There are two major types of content to distinguish: articles and pages.
Articles are the main content of your site, like blog posts.
Pages are relatively static, like &#8216;about&#8217; or &#8216;contact&#8217; pages.
Let&#8217;s start with one of&nbsp;each.</p>
<p>Create a folder, <code>content/pages/</code>, make a new file called, <code>about.md</code>, and give it the following&nbsp;contents:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">Title</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">About</span>
<span class="n">Author</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">My</span> <span class="n">Name</span>

<span class="n">Bonjour</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">wilkommen</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="n">kono</span> <span class="n">blog</span><span class="o">.</span>
</pre></div>


<p>You can (should) replace all of that with the relevant information that you would like to have&nbsp;displayed.</p>
<p>Next, create a file called, <code>content/test.md</code>, and give it the following&nbsp;contents:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">Title</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">Test</span> <span class="n">Post</span>
<span class="n">Date</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="mi">1997</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">08</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">29</span> <span class="mi">02</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="mi">14</span>
<span class="n">Tags</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">testtag</span>
<span class="n">Author</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">My</span> <span class="n">Name</span>
<span class="n">Summary</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">This</span> <span class="k">is</span> <span class="n">an</span> <span class="n">article</span>

<span class="n">Geometric</span> <span class="n">growth</span> <span class="k">is</span> <span class="n">the</span> <span class="n">discrete</span> <span class="n">version</span> <span class="n">of</span> <span class="n">exponential</span> <span class="n">growth</span><span class="o">.</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Notice how the files begin with metadata that are not Markdown syntax.
Pelican will interpret these fields when it translates the Markdown into <span class="caps">HTML</span>.
You can read more about this section <a href="http://docs.getpelican.com/en/latest/content.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>You now have a few different ways of generating the html of your shiny new website.
The most direct is to run <code>pelican path/to/content/</code>.
This will generate a folder called, <code>output/</code>, which contains the static html for your blog.
Equivalently, you can run <code>make html</code> with the same result.
There are a few settings at the top of <code>Makefile</code> that you may wish to edit, but the defaults are probably good.
What you&#8217;re asking Pelican to do here is to examine the files in <code>content/</code> and the settings in <code>pelicanconf.py</code> to translate everything into your new website.
Eventually, you&#8217;ll send the contents of <code>output</code> to wherever the files will be hosted&#8212;GitHub Pages, in my&nbsp;case.</p>
<p>Once you&#8217;ve done this, to view this in a web browser, you&#8217;ll need to start a webserver from within the <code>output</code> folder.
Fortunately, Python comes with one.
If you&#8217;re running python 2 (you probably are) you can run <code>python -m SimpleHTTPServer</code>.
If you&#8217;re running python 3, the command is <code>python3 -m http.server</code>.
Possibly easier, you can run <code>make serve</code> from the root folder of your project (i.e. one level above <code>content/</code>).
The Makefile specifies where the output goes, so it will know where to go to&nbsp;serve.</p>
<p>Now open a web browser, navigate to <code>http://localhost:8000</code> and see the results of your work so&nbsp;far!</p>
<p>Of course, the authors of Pelican have provided even more convenience for you.
Given this workflow so far, every time you update a file, you have to regenerate the html to see the updates in your web browser.
Stop webserver, save, <code>make html</code>, <code>make serve</code> after every change.
Instead, you can run <code>make devserver</code> once which does three things.
First, it generates the html of your site.
Second, it starts a webserver at port 8000 as before.
Third, it detects when content gets updated and will regenerate the html automatically.
All you have to do is save content then refresh your browser to see the latest.
When you&#8217;re done editing and want to stop the webserver process, run <code>make stopserver</code>.</p>
<h1>Version&nbsp;control</h1>
<p>It&#8217;s not necessary, but it&#8217;s probably a good idea to keep a version history of your blog contents.
I&#8217;m going to assume the reader is familiar with git, github, and creating new repositories.
I advise putting <code>cache/</code>, <code>output/</code>, and <code>*.pyc</code> in <code>.gitignore</code> at minimum, but the other files are probably worth tracking..
My blog contents are <a href="https://github.com/justalfred/justalfred-blog">here</a>.
If this part isn&#8217;t clear to you, feel free to email or tweet at me, and I&#8217;ll add more&nbsp;detail.</p>
<h1><a href="http://docs.getpelican.com/en/latest/tips.html#extra-tips">Custom&nbsp;domain</a></h1>
<p>If you own a domain that you&#8217;d like to use, this is how; otherwise skip this section.
First, create a file called <code>CNAME</code> in a new folder, <code>/content/extra</code>.
Edit the file so the only contents are the domain you want to use, e.g.: <code>blog.justalfred.com</code>.
Next, edit your <code>pelicanconf.py</code> to add the following&nbsp;lines:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">STATIC_PATHS</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="s">&#39;extra/CNAME&#39;</span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="n">EXTRA_PATH_METADATA</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="s">&#39;extra/CNAME&#39;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="s">&#39;path&#39;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s">&#39;CNAME&#39;</span><span class="p">},}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Now, all links generated will use your <span class="caps">CNAME</span> as the base domain!
You can regenerate your site and see where the <span class="caps">CNAME</span> file ends up.
Of course, there&#8217;s nothing special about the folder, <code>extra/</code>, but this seems to be the&nbsp;convention.</p>
<h1><a href="http://docs.getpelican.com/en/latest/tips.html#extra-tips">robots.txt</a></h1>
<p>If you care about web crawlers indexing certain portions of your site, you can create a file, <code>extra/robots.txt</code>.
This <a href="http://www.robotstxt.org/robotstxt.html">establishes a policy</a> that web crawlers are recommended to follow.
The major ones will respect your settings.
Mine has the following&nbsp;contents:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>User-agent: *
Disallow: /drafts/
Disallow: /theme/
</pre></div>


<p>If you didn&#8217;t follow the last portion, you will have to add the following to your <code>pelicanconf.py</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">STATIC_PATHS</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="s">&#39;extra/robots.txt&#39;</span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="n">EXTRA_PATH_METADATA</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="s">&#39;extra/robots.txt&#39;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="s">&#39;path&#39;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s">&#39;robots.txt&#39;</span><span class="p">},}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>If you did, edit the relevant lines&nbsp;to:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">STATIC_PATHS</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="s">&#39;extra/CNAME&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&#39;extra/robots.txt&#39;</span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="n">EXTRA_PATH_METADATA</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="s">&#39;extra/CNAME&#39;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="s">&#39;path&#39;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s">&#39;CNAME&#39;</span><span class="p">},</span>
                       <span class="s">&#39;extra/robots.txt&#39;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="s">&#39;path&#39;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s">&#39;robots.txt&#39;</span><span class="p">},</span>
               <span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>


<h1>Typogrify</h1>
<p>If you chose to install <code>typogrify</code> earlier, you&#8217;ll want to enable it.
Add the following to your <code>pelicanconf.py</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">TYPOGRIFY</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="bp">True</span>
</pre></div>


<h1>Pelican&nbsp;themes</h1>
<p>If you want to customize the look of your site, you can get pretty far by using one of the <a href="https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-themes">packaged themes</a>.
I chose the &#8216;<a href="https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-themes/tree/master/pelican-bootstrap3">pelican-bootstrap3</a>&#8216; theme because of its completeness and simplicity.
It has a minimalist aeshthetic, it&#8217;s responsive, it recognizes a host of extra settings.
It can be further customized by editing a custom <span class="caps">CSS</span> file as described <a href="https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-themes/tree/master/pelican-bootstrap3#custom-css">here</a>, but I haven&#8217;t gotten around to that.
Whichever theme you choose, clone the &#8216;pelican-themes&#8217; repo, and add the following to your <code>pelicanconf.py</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>THEME = &#39;path/to/pelican-themes/chosen-theme&#39;
</pre></div>


<h1>Time&nbsp;zone</h1>
<p>You will probably want to set the time zone that your site uses.
This <a href="http://docs.getpelican.com/en/latest/settings.html#timezone">seems</a> to be mostly important if you set up <span class="caps">RSS</span> or Atom feeds later on (which I recommend; I love <span class="caps">RSS</span>).
Simply add the following to your <code>pelicanconf.py</code> with the appropriate time&nbsp;zone:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">TIMEZONE</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&#39;America/New_York&#39;</span>
</pre></div>


<h1>publishconf.py</h1>
<p>As mentioned earlier, <code>publishconf.py</code> is much like <code>pelicanconf.py</code>, but the settings listed there are only applied for final conversion.
For instance, you probably don&#8217;t want to include Google Analytics tracking in your draft versions of your site; only in the version that you finally&nbsp;publish.</p>
<p>Speaking of it, the first thing you&#8217;ll want to add is probably Google Analytics tracking.
Add the tracking id to <code>publishconf.py</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">GOOGLE_ANALYTICS</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&quot;UA-XXXXXXXX-X&quot;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>If you want to generate an <span class="caps">RSS</span> feed (some of us still use <span class="caps">RSS</span>) you can do that quite simply&nbsp;here:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">FEED_DOMAIN</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">SITEURL</span>
<span class="n">FEED_ALL_RSS</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&#39;feeds/all.rss.xml&#39;</span>
<span class="n">CATEGORY_FEED_RSS</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&#39;feeds/</span><span class="si">%s</span><span class="s">.rss.xml&#39;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>If you want to use <a href="https://disqus.com/">Disqus</a> to enable comments (I haven&#8217;t decided to do that yet. Email or tweet at me if I should.), you can add the sitename in this file as&nbsp;well.</p>
<p>Once you&#8217;re ready to share your site with the world, you can generate a final version of your site.
<code>pelican content -s publishconf.py</code> and <code>make publish</code> are equivalent commands to do this.
It&#8217;s a good idea to delete the output folder first.
Everything will be regenerated, but if you made changes that left behind some old versions of old files, you want to be sure to clear those.
Note: when your site gets beyond a certain point, you may want to speed up the conversion process by having Pelican <a href="http://docs.getpelican.com/en/latest/settings.html#reading-only-modified-content">only read modified content</a>.
I haven&#8217;t tried this&nbsp;yet.</p>
<p>Once you&#8217;ve run one of those two publish commands, you can upload your content to wherever they will be hosted.
If you&#8217;re using GitHub Pages like me, you&#8217;ll want to create a repository named, <code>USERNAME.github.io</code>, with your username.
Any repo following this naming scheme will be <a href="https://pages.github.com/">recognized and served automatically</a>.
You can then simply push your content to the master branch of that repo, and wait a few minutes to see it appear at <code>http://USERNAME.github.io</code>!</p>
<p>Note, if you set up a <span class="caps">CNAME</span> earlier, you&#8217;ll also want to go to your domain name registrar and edit the <span class="caps">DNS</span> settings to point to the right&nbsp;place.</p>
<h1>Import old&nbsp;blog</h1>
<p>Since I was migrating posts out of Blogger, I did this in a three-step process.
First, I used Blogger&#8217;s <a href="https://support.google.com/blogger/answer/97416?hl=en">export <span class="caps">XML</span> functionality</a> to retrieve my content.
Second, I ran the following command to convert the <span class="caps">XML</span> to&nbsp;Markdown.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>pelican-import -m markdown --feed --dir-page blog___.xml --dir-cat
</pre></div>


<p>Third, I wrote a python script to do a bit of cleanup.
Haha That&#8217;s the hand-wavy magic answer.
But you can see my script <a href="https://github.com/justalfred/justalfred-blog/blob/master/convert.py">here</a> and edit it to suit your&nbsp;needs.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Every coding tutorial ever written. - <a href="https://twitter.com/ossia">@ossia</a> <a href="http://t.co/kV3XFbBAf7">pic.twitter.com/kV3XFbBAf7</a></p>&mdash; Rich Rogers (@RichRogersHDS) <a href="https://twitter.com/RichRogersHDS/status/592006956954423298">April 25, 2015</a></blockquote>

<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Sorry.</p>
<h1>Next&nbsp;steps</h1>
<p>As I mentioned, Pelican is easily extended and customized.
Check out <a href="https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-plugins">pelican plugins</a> for a large collection of extensions.
So far, I&#8217;m only using <code>tag_cloud</code>.
I also recommend going through all the available <a href="http://docs.getpelican.com/en/latest/settings.html">settings</a> to see if you might like some non-default behavior.
The particular theme that you choose may have other settings as well.
Finally, you can edit style to your heart&#8217;s content.
Or not at&nbsp;all.</p>
<p>If anything didn&#8217;t work quite right or if you&#8217;d like me to expand on any section, please email me or tweet at me.
Happy&nbsp;Blogging!</p>
