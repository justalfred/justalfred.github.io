<p>Welcome to my new classical music blog. As you probably know, I&#8217;m
approaching the end of my PhD work in condensed matter physics. In the
time I&#8217;ve been here I&#8217;ve found myself more and more enamored with the
world of classical music, by which I mean Western art music. Bravo if
you know why the former term is somewhat ambiguous. Visitors to this
site probably fall under two categories. You&#8217;re probably either
scientifically-inclined with a curiosity about classical music, or
you&#8217;re one of my friends who was a music major. I aim to write primarily
for the former group. I want to spread this love I have so that more
people can come to appreciate the beauty that I experience. But I ask
for assistance from the latter group. I may know more than the average
person, but I will leave out details or context or get things wrong from
time to time. I make no claim to be an expert (not even with physics,
ha!). I mean really, I&#8217;ve only very recently begun to be able to discern
the form of a piece I&#8217;m listening to. (I still suck at it, but it&#8217;s
pretty exciting.) In my never-ending quest to learn more about classical
music, I ask that you enrich my posts with any knowledge, corrections,
opinions, or suggestions that you have. Even if you&#8217;re saying that a
post is completely erroneous or naive, I will love you for it. You may
even gain something from the physical/scientific perspective I may take.
We&#8217;ll see how it&nbsp;goes.  </p>
<p>As I&#8217;ve stated, my primary reason for starting this blog is to share my
passion with the uninitiated. I plan to do this by sharing stories,
articles, and videos with you. I may write about a piece that&#8217;s stuck in
my head, concerts I&#8217;ve attended, or some factoid that I think is
entertaining. I already have a list of topics going. Requests will be
honored if I feel capable. Should I be allowed to post on other topics
that strike my fancy such as food, literature, or science? I haven&#8217;t
decided. For now I think it&#8217;s best to keep this blog to one&nbsp;topic.  </p>
<p>So let me start things off by sharing my background with classical
music. Through playing the violin in middle and high school, I came to
know much of the standard violin and symphonic repertoire. But I found
myself far outclassed by the time I reached college to continue playing.
So I lost my enthusiasm for, but was never too far removed from,
classical music. Then I attended a monumental (for me) concert during my
first year here in grad school. I had seen and met this particular
violinist in college when she was just starting to cause a stir in the
classical music community and was awestruck by her talents then. Seeing
the now-world-famous <a href="http://www.hilaryhahn.com/">Hilary Hahn</a> perform
the Glazunov <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2mnr81jCWw">violin
concerto</a> (and the Ernst
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UWNCbpwC-PQ">transcription</a> of
Schubert&#8217;s <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OHJ0QwmzFs">Der Erlkönig</a> as
her encore) ignited in me a new passion for this music that&#8217;s persisted
since. Yes, I met her again after that concert, and yes, she&#8217;s still my
favorite musician ever. But that story is worth a post of its own. At
this point I started listening and listening to my old favorite
symphonies and violin concertos, then to ones I didn&#8217;t know and also to
piano concertos, cello concertos, lieder, chamber pieces, opera,
sonatas, character pieces, and so on. Eventually I took a freshman level
music history class which was wonderful for consolidating and organizing
the random tidbits that I knew. That was followed by a group
introductory piano class and, most recently, private lessons in piano. I
go to concerts when I can, especially if I&#8217;m traveling, and I started a
small group to watch operas on DVDs. To say I&#8217;m hooked is an&nbsp;understatement.  </p>
<p>A <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/deceptivecadence/2010/09/23/130076390/classical-fans-tell-stories-of-first-loves?ft=1&amp;f=129702125">recent
segment</a>
on &#8220;All Things Considered&#8221; discussed listeners&#8217; &#8216;first loves&#8217; in
classical music. I encourage you to follow the link. Some of the stories
are particularly moving. Specifically, though, they asked about pieces
of music. That disqualifies Hilary Hahn as my answer, so I&#8217;ll give my
actual first. The earliest piece I can remember loving is Antonio
Vivaldi&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rhvtm9LmXI">The Four
Seasons</a>.&#8221; I guarantee
you&#8217;ll recognize it. My uncle had a videotape of some ensemble (which
one I never knew) performing it. I remember the short, fat, old solo
violinist&#8217;s impeccable technique bewildering my young mind. That image
with the evocative and memorable melodies gave me a reason to practice
my technique. Eventually, I was able to hack my way through the suite,
which I did. Often. Much to my classmates&#8217; chagrin. I&#8217;m somewhat
thankful that no recordings exist of my playing back then. It would be
painful to hear&nbsp;today.  </p>
<p>So that&#8217;s <span style="font-style: italic;">my</span> first love in
classical music. If you have one, what&#8217;s <span
style="font-style: italic;">yours</span>? Do share. I would love to
hear. Please comment or message/email me about this post and others you
find interesting in the future. If I don&#8217;t feel that I&#8217;m reaching anyone
or learning anything in the process, it will be hard for me to continue
this. I&#8217;ve enabled anonymous posting. As regards the title, well, it
makes sense if you know my given name. Thanks for reading. I hope we can
keep this&nbsp;up.</p>
