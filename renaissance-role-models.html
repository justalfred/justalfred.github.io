                <p>Who are your role models? Who are the people you try to emulate in some
aspect or other of life? Maybe parents? Maybe celebrities? Maybe fictional
characters? What are they like as&nbsp;people?</p>
<p>Who are your celebrity crushes? Who are the people you like to look at
or watch? Maybe film stars? Maybe athletes or models? What are they like
as&nbsp;people?</p>
<p>Did anyone come up in both&nbsp;lists?</p>
<p>I guess that most people would answer no. I guess also that for most people,
the second list is longer. Probably a lot longer. And that&#8217;s&nbsp;unfortunate.</p>
<p>I read an interesting piece recently about <a href="http://www.thebookoflife.org/on-using-sex-to-sell/">advertising in the age of the
Renaissance</a>.
I haven&#8217;t been able to verify all the details, but the central ideas were
familiar to an art historian friend of mine. Here&#8217;s the&nbsp;gist.</p>
<p><a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ficino/">Marcilio Ficino</a>, an Italian
Renaissance Philosopher under the employ of the Medici family, wanted art to
educate. Art triggers contemplation if it engenders a desire to understand. We
desire to understand when we feel the engagement of love. And the quickest path
to love is to appeal at a sexual&nbsp;level.</p>
<p>In short, sexy advertising is a quick means to capturing attention which we
can then steer towards high&nbsp;aims.</p>
<p>The closest direct quote of Ficino&#8217;s I&#8217;ve found refers to beauty rather than
sex appeal, but the idea still merits&nbsp;conversation.</p>
<p>Whereas Renaissance art would depict idealized human forms,
often nude, to convey grace, harmony, and compassion, these days the idealized
human forms portrayed convey little more than material and physical notions.
That&#8217;s a lost opportunity. We have sex appeal down to a science. What if we
could harness that power to improve&nbsp;society?</p>
<p>At a smaller scale, I think we might do our communities a service by
attempting to perform as sexy/beautiful role models ourselves.
We could collectively decide to be the best people
we can be, and through charisma and style inspire others to emulate us. I
definitely don&#8217;t mean all others. I&#8217;m certainly one who can only ever hope
to appeal to a small subslice of the general population. But for the people
who find something attractive about the way I carry myself, I want them to
discover other virtues as they learn more about me. Those who have more charm
and good looks can hope to positively influence more&nbsp;people.</p>
<p>Most of us already try to be good people, and most of us also already try
to present well. What&#8217;s novel in this mindset is in the motivation of
the latter. You might style your hair, dress of a fashion, or apply your
makeup with the aim of being respectable to colleagues, comfortable for
a setting, or simply to feel attractive. Seldom do we do so with the aim
of inspiring others. With this mindset, an otherwise
vain concern gains a measure of&nbsp;nobility.</p>
<p>I like this idea so far, but I see two major pitfalls to consider. I&#8217;d love
to hear of&nbsp;others.</p>
<p>First, this is a wholly different proposition for men and women.
The standards of beauty/sexiness are vastly unequal. This argument can
easily be interpreted as an elaborate way of telling women to &#8216;smile&#8217;, a
detestably common occurrence resulting from many men&#8217;s misguided belief
that women are supposed to make them feel good. I am not encouraging anyone
to diminish herself or&nbsp;himself.</p>
<p>Be sexy in whatever way you wish to be (sexy doesn&#8217;t have to be sexual) and
beautiful in the ways that you know you are.
Embody the virtues you wish for the world to celebrate. Let these two efforts
support and motivate each other. I want us to celebrate the
best of ourselves. Not to objectify or dehumanize&nbsp;ourselves.</p>
<p>Second, to the last point, serving as a role model can be interpreted as only
communicating the happy, positive, strong, successful sides of ourselves.
I think this is a damaging pattern, and I think we should be allowed to share
our darker, weaker selves. Let&#8217;s not pretend to be perfect. Everyone faces
some degree of adversity. Let&#8217;s demonstrate ways to face it with poise,
compassion, and&nbsp;humility.</p>
<p>One&#8217;s quality as a human being and one&#8217;s fitness as a role model should have
nothing to do with your attractiveness, but human nature isn&#8217;t so egalitarian.
Instead of lamenting this flaw in our wiring, let&#8217;s exploit it to better&nbsp;society.</p>
<p>(footnote: there are psychological studies that support many of the claims
and observations here, but as an outsider to the domain, I don&#8217;t know which
are well established and which have yet to be replicated. So I decided not
to reference literature whose quality I don&#8217;t&nbsp;understand.)</p>
<p>postscript 2016-05-28: After a couple months letting this stew, I think the
call to action here shouldn&#8217;t be to pretty ourselves up. Not everyone wants to
be the object of attention. We <strong>should</strong> try to embody the virtues we admire
anyway. I don&#8217;t have a problem with that part. So the real call to action is
just to notice those who choose to combine physical appeal with other virtues
and not see it as distracting from those virtues. It&#8217;s ok for a professor
to be hot in more ways than&nbsp;one.</p>
